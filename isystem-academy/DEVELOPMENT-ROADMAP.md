# iSystem Academy Development Roadmap

This document provides a structured roadmap for improving the iSystem Academy project and preparing it for deployment on Vercel.

## Project Overview

iSystem Academy is a Next.js application designed to provide digital skills education through online courses and local workshops in Breda, Netherlands. The platform targets newcomers who need assistance with digital skills for work, life, and community integration.

## Development Guides

The following guides will help you implement the necessary changes:

1. [Vercel Deployment Guide](./docs/VERCEL-DEPLOYMENT.md) - Instructions for deploying to Vercel
2. [Code Improvements Guide](./docs/CODE-IMPROVEMENTS.md) - Technical debt and code quality fixes
3. [Internationalization Guide](./docs/I18N-OPTIMIZATION.md) - Optimizing the internationalization approach
4. [Performance Guide](./docs/PERFORMANCE.md) - Performance optimization recommendations

## Priority Order

We recommend addressing the changes in the following order:

1. **High Priority (Phase 1)**
   - Fix Next.js configuration for Vercel
   - Update image optimization settings
   - Clean up routing structure

2. **Medium Priority (Phase 2)**
   - Improve code quality by fixing TypeScript and ESLint errors
   - Optimize internationalization implementation
   - Enhance mobile responsiveness

3. **Low Priority (Phase 3)**
   - Implement analytics
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Consider CMS integration if needed

## Development Timeline

| Phase | Task | Estimated Effort | Dependencies |
|-------|------|------------------|--------------|
| 1 | Next.js Configuration Updates | 1-2 days | None |
| 1 | Image Optimization | 1 day | None |
| 1 | Routing Structure Cleanup | 2-3 days | None |
| 2 | Fix TypeScript/ESLint Errors | 2-3 days | Phase 1 |
| 2 | Optimize Internationalization | 3-4 days | Phase 1 |
| 2 | Mobile Responsiveness | 2-3 days | None |
| 3 | Analytics Implementation | 1-2 days | Phase 1 |
| 3 | CI/CD Pipeline | 2 days | Phase 1 & 2 |
| 3 | CMS Integration (if needed) | 5+ days | Phase 1 & 2 |

## Conclusion

Following this roadmap will ensure a smooth transition from the current shared hosting setup to Vercel deployment while maintaining and improving the functionality and quality of the iSystem Academy application.
